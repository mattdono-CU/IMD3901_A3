Two players are locked in separate rooms that require coloured blocks to be placed on matching pads on the floor to escape.
Both players have access to a button that will change the colour of their room to reveal blocks and pads of differing colours but pressing one button chnages the colour of both rooms.
If both players press their buttons at the same time, both of their rooms will turn white to reveal all coloured blocks and their corresponding pads.
Players must race against each other or work together to find and place all of their blocks on the correct pads by swapping room colours.
Either way, there can only be one winner.

Who will escape and who will be remain chromatose?
